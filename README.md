iSherpa - How It Works

Welcome to iSherpa! A community to read and share guides on any subject! To read another user's guide, you need to pay with a token. How do you earn tokens? By writing your own guide! Also, if another user reads your guide, you'll earn a token! Your token wallet is visible on the navigation bar once you log in.

Keep reading, writing, and sharing guides! Enjoy! -The iSherpa Team
